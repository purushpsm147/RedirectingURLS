# RedirectingURLS
Here is simple C# code that will read a list of URLs from a text file and programatically check whether any link in file gets redirected to some other location on the web. If it does it will write to those links to another text file.

Also, The redirected urls will be stored and saved to a text file for reference purposes. All this is done directly from the browser and without opening the browser. 

You can modify the code as you like it.

The code is a simple console application developed in Visual Studios.
